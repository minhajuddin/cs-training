#Contact manager
It must store name, address, email and phone of every contact.
It should store all the contacts in a CSV file. A user should be able to create/edit
and view all the contacts through a Menu Driven interface.
User should be able to search by name,email or number. Your solution should be OOP driven.

  1. A user should be able to add a new contact *1 marks*
  2. A user should be able to view a list of existing contacts *1 marks*
  3. A user should be able to delete a contact *1 mark*
  4. A user should be able to search for a contact based on name *2 marks*
  5. A user should be able to edit an existing contact *3 marks*
  6. Write a website using Sinatra that uses the same CSV file to *2 marks*
      show the contacts. For example: localhost:3000/contacts should list all the
      contacts. And localhost:3000/contacts/1 should list the first contact in the
      CSV file. localhost:3000/contacts/2 should list the second. If no contact exists
      for the given index, it should return an appropriate status code.
